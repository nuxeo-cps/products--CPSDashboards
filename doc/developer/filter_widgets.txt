This is the developer's documentation for the widgets that manipulate
filtering and sorting for CPSDashboards's dashboards.

The general idea is that these widgets put in datastructure all
elements that tabular widgets, like the Catalog Tabular Widget will
use to perform their lookup of items to display.

The source of data for these widgets is (in ascending priority):

* the datamodel. Typically, this comes from the document or portlet
  used for the whole dashboard and can be used as persistent default
  parameters.
* a cookie. This makes for session-time persistent parameters.
* the request. For example, if one of these widgets is rendered in
  edit mode, along with a submit <input> tag, then submission will
  have the effect of putting new parameters in the datastructure,
  hence triggering a new lookup and rendering of the tabular widgets.

We'll use a fake DataModel throughout in order not to be bothered in
the examples by the numerous security checks that the full-featured
one provides::

    >>> from Products.CPSSchemas.tests.testWidgets import FakeDataModel
    >>> from Products.CPSSchemas.DataStructure import DataStructure

RequestCookiesMixin
------------------

  This is a mixin class that provides the preparation of datastructure
  from request and cookie. Widgets that subclass this and a widget
  class can call explicitely the usual prepare methode and the one
  provided by RequestCookiesMixin::

    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.widgets.filter_widgets \
    ...                         import RequestCookiesMixin
    >>> mixin = RequestCookiesMixin()

  The cookie parsing is optional and depends on the non-emptiness of
  the 'cookie_id' property.

  We'll need some imports to deal with cookies::

    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.testing import FakeRequestWithCookies
    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.utils import serializeForCookie
    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.utils import unserializeFromCookie

  And some general widget stuff::

    >>> from Products.CPSSchemas.Widget import widgetname


Cookie expiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Suppose the widget is being used for a CPSDocument instance,
  e.g., a dashboard or a portlet. Then the values stored in ZODB will behave
  as default values: the filtering criteria ones you get when
  you use it for the first time. When one changes them, cookies must
  expire at validation time, otherwise it could look as if nothing happened.

  On the other hand, if the datamodel refers to transient data, as in
  the advanced search form, the cookie mustn't expire at validation
  time, because validation will happpen on all search results pages.
  Expiring the cookie effectively breaks column-sorting capabilities
  since these are simple HTTP GETs providing the *change* in
  filtering options only.

  Fortunately, the layout mode is different in these two diametrally
  opposed use cases, and ``validate()`` receives it in its keyword args.

  The actual expiration is handled by ``_expireCookie()``. Let's
  replace it by a logger for the purposes of demonstration::

    >>> def _expireCookie():
    ...     print 'Expired'
    >>> mixin._expireCookie = _expireCookie

  In edit mode, we are changing ZODB persistent data, but we won't do
  anything if the ``cookie_id`` property is not set::

    >>> mixin.expireCookie(layout_mode='edit')
    >>> mixin.cookie_id = 'the_cookie'
    >>> mixin.expireCookie(layout_mode='edit')
    Expired

  In view or search_results modes, we are always changing parameters
  on the fly, we need not to expire::

    >>> mixin.expireCookie(layout_mode='view')
    >>> mixin.expireCookie(layout_mode='search_results')

  Now let's check that the genuine ``_expireCookie`` does its job,
  that is forwarding to the response object.

    >>> mixin = RequestCookiesMixin()
    >>> mixin.cookie_id = 'the_cookie'
    >>> mixin.REQUEST = FakeRequestWithCookies()
    >>> resp = mixin.REQUEST.RESPONSE
    >>> resp.setCookie('the_cookie', 'abcd', path='/')
    >>> resp.cookies['the_cookie']['value']
    'abcd'
    >>> mixin._expireCookie()
    FakeResponse: called expireCookie with arg=the_cookie

CPSSelectFilterWidget
---------------------

  This is a widget that subclasses CPSSelectWidget and parses request
  and cookies.

  It also has an additional property, 'defines_scope' (a boolean). If
  this is set to true, it puts the full vocabulary list of adds
  another (key, item) pair in the
  datastructure in case the normal value is empty. This tells the
  query mechanism the full scope of the search, which might be more
  restrictive than no search.
  Also, the additional reject_from_scope property (tokens) specifies
  keys to exclude from the scope. Typical use-case: you want to filter
  based on workflow states, but one of them corresponds to closed
  files.
  Finally, there's the ``total_scope`` property if you want to fix the scope no
  matter what. Use-case: base rpath.


Fixed Filter Widget
-------------------

  A trivial one that puts its 'value' property in datastructure for
search criteria that don't depend on user input at all and aren't in
schema.

String Filter Widget
--------------------

  Like a String Widget, cookie-request enabled


CPSToggableCriterionWidget
--------------------------

This widget is meant to trigger/toggle a criterion (typically a sort)
It manipulates three fields, in that order:

#. the criterion (e.g, on what to sort)
#. the token (e.g, how to sort)
#. an additional reference (e.g, where the request comes from).

Namings in the datastructure are based on the following properties:

* criterion_suffix (defaults to '-on')
* token_suffix (defaults to '-order')
* ref_suffix. (defaults to '-col')

    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.widgets.filter_widgets import\
    ...               CPSToggableCriterionWidget, FakeRequest
    >>> sort_wid = CPSToggableCriterionWidget('Query sort')
    >>> sort_wid.fields = ['crit', 'token', 'ref']

The token possible values are stored as a property, too::

    >>> sort_wid.manage_changeProperties(toggle_tokens=('usual', 'alternate',))

Let's simulate a request::

    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST = FakeRequest(**{'widget__Query sort':'myindex',
    ...                                   'widget__Query sort-col':'mycol'})

The widget really needs to start with a datamodel which has the three
mentionned fields, so let's make one and start with empty fields::

    >>> dm = FakeDataModel()
    >>> for x in ['crit', 'token', 'ref']:
    ...     dm[x] = None
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=dm)

This is how the Toggable Criterion widget interprets the request and writes to
the datastructure::

    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> from pprint import PrettyPrinter
    >>> pprint=PrettyPrinter(width=50).pprint
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'usual', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'myindex'}

The request parsing takes place after loading from datamodel and cookie.
If the request's criterion is the same as the one in datastructure after
these two steps, and the filter_button is in request's form
(be it through a button or a GET link as the one generated in column headers by
the standard widget_tabular_render),
the widget iterates the token (here, sort-order). So let's
fill the datamodel with values that give the same datastructure as the last
one before request parsing::

    >>> dm['crit'] = 'myindex'
    >>> dm['token'] = 'usual'
    >>> sort_wid.manage_changeProperties(filter_button='ze_filter')
    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST.form['ze_filter'] = 'yes'
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'alternate', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'myindex'}

A change of criterion doesn't toggle but resets the token to its first
value. The same happens if the filter_button property is set and
request's form lacks it::

    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST.form['widget__Query sort'] = 'another'
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'usual', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'another'}
    >>> del sort_wid.REQUEST.form['ze_filter']
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'usual', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'another'}
    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST.form['ze_filter'] = 'put back'

Some robustness: don't fail if the ref is missing from request::

    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST = FakeRequest(**{'widget__Query sort':'myindex'})
    >>> sort_wid.fields = sort_wid.fields[:2]
    >>> del dm['ref']
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=dm)
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'usual', 'Query sort-on': 'myindex'}

This works about the same if there is no associated fields. Let's replay
some of it::

    >>> sort_wid.fields = ()
    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST = FakeRequest(**{'widget__Query sort':'myindex',
    ...                                   'widget__Query sort-col':'mycol'})
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=FakeDataModel())
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> from pprint import PrettyPrinter
    >>> pprint=PrettyPrinter(width=50).pprint
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'usual', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'myindex'}

Now let's check that the toggling works::

    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST = FakeRequestWithCookies(
    ...                                 **{'widget__Query sort':'myindex',
    ...                                    'widget__Query sort-col':'mycol',
    ...                                    'ze_filter': 'still here'})
    >>> sort_wid.REQUEST.cookies = {'Query sort-order': 'usual'}
    >>> sort_wid.prepare(ds)
    >>> pprint(ds)
    {'Query sort-order': 'alternate', 'Query sort-col': 'mycol', 'Query sort-on': 'myindex'}


Int Filter Widget
-----------------
The int filter widget passes queries about integer values, together
with how to use them. This is specified in the widget properties,
and is written to datastructure with a suffix.

    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.widgets.filter_widgets import\
    ...               CPSIntFilterWidget
    >>> widget = CPSIntFilterWidget('the_widget')
    >>> widget.REQUEST = FakeRequest()
    >>> widget.default_charset = 'iso-8859-15' # normally acquired from portal
    >>> widget.manage_changeProperties(fields=('int',))

Let's make datamodel and datastructure::

    >>> dm = FakeDataModel()
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=dm)
    >>> dm['int'] = 3

Now let's go through preparation. It is vital for queries that the datastructure
value's type stays an int, and that's a major difference with the usual
Int Widget::

    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['the_widget']
    3

Same must be true with cookies and request form, and they follow the
usual precedence rules::

    >>> widget.manage_changeProperties(cookie_id='cooked')
    >>> cooked = serializeForCookie({'the_widget': 2})
    >>> widget.REQUEST.cookies = {'cooked': cooked}
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['the_widget']
    2
    >>> widget.REQUEST.form = {widgetname('the_widget'): '1'}
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['the_widget']
    1


DateTime Filter Widget
----------------------
The DateTime Filter widget has to reinterpret the three pieces of data
that go in datastructure to represent a DateTime object.

    >>> from DateTime.DateTime import DateTime
    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.widgets.filter_widgets import\
    ...               CPSDateTimeFilterWidget
    >>> widget = CPSDateTimeFilterWidget('datetime')
    >>> widget.REQUEST = FakeRequestWithCookies()
    >>> widget.default_charset = 'iso-8859-15' # normally acquired from portal
    >>> widget.manage_changeProperties(fields=('deadline',),
    ...                                cookie_id='the_cookie')
    >>> class FakeTranslationService:
    ...       def getSelectedLanguage(self):
    ...          return 'fr'
    >>> widget.translation_service = FakeTranslationService()

Let's make datamodel and datastructure::

    >>> dm = FakeDataModel()
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=dm)
    >>> dm['deadline'] = DateTime('2006-06-06')

Now let's try with a cookie::

    >>> cookie = serializeForCookie({'datetime_date': '03/07/2006',
    ...                              'datetime_hour': '3',
    ...                              'datetime_minute': '57'})
    >>> widget.REQUEST['cookies']['the_cookie'] = cookie
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> dt = ds['datetime']
    >>> isinstance(dt, DateTime)
    True
    >>> dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
    '2006-07-03 03:57'

And now as usual, request form takes precedence::

    >>> widget.REQUEST.form.update({'widget__datetime_date': '05/07/2006',
    ...                             'widget__datetime_hour': '13',
    ...                             'widget__datetime_minute': '28'})
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> dt = ds['datetime']
    >>> isinstance(dt, DateTime)
    True
    >>> dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
    '2006-07-05 13:28'

To Do Filter Widget
-------------------

This is the filter brother of Multi Boolean Widget, that is it is
designed to choose among mutually exclusive criteria.

This is useful for high level flags, depending ,e.g, on wf states,
localroles amd so on. For instance what has to be done on some document
can depend on this

It can translates the vocabulary key in a boolean query::

    >>> from Products.CPSDashboards.widgets.filter_widgets import\
    ...               CPSToDoFilterWidget
    >>> widget = CPSToDoFilterWidget('the_widget')
    >>> widget.manage_changeProperties(fields=('todo',))
    >>> widget.REQUEST = FakeRequest()

Let's make datamodel and datastructure::

    >>> dm = FakeDataModel()
    >>> ds = DataStructure(datamodel=dm)
    >>> dm['todo'] = 'handle'

Now let's go through preparation. Note that the field value is put in
datastructure like a Select Widget would do, too. This is
for the rendering part::

    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['the_widget']
    'handle'
    >>> ds['the_widget-handle']
    True

In addition, the widget can forward non-boolean queries to several indexes::

    >>> widget.manage_changeProperties(forward_values=['dead', 'flying'],
    ...                                forward_indexes=['state', 'type'])
    >>> dm['todo'] = 'dead'
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['state']
    'dead'
    >>> dm['todo'] = 'flying'
    >>> widget.prepare(ds)
    >>> ds['type']
    'flying'

It's now the job of the catalog widget to convert to the needed query,
for example replacing the above booleans by the list of groyps the
user belongs to. Note that you'll have to use the same prefix
convention in ``forward_values`` as you did for the widget id for this
to work.
